Backyard Loupe

A long long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away

Your last letter stopped, Mind the boat. Its toxic bottom paint (mixed for ablation)

shaped its runoff hull through barren topsoil. Ignored, the wineglass bilge filled and froze.

The Dimeric strained but was saved by its shape, tiny berg’s innate tendency to rise.


Uncle and I mothballed the spinnaker and jib, shouldered off the cat-scratched ice collected

in the cabin, cast halite below. The cause was the tarp, letting past what could have sheared

the hull, splayed gas fumes and fish scales, revealed a view we never cared to know.


I put my temple to the snow for you, and looked toward where the keel kissed the dirt.
